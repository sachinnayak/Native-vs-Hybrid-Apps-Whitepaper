At this moment we have a two different approaches for creating mobile applications: native and hybrid. Each of these approaches has its own drawbacks and benefits. But everytime it's very difficult to choose the right one to go. The purpose of this document is 
  

## <a id=approaches></a> Mobile Application Development Approaches 

### <a id=native></a> Native Applications

Native applications are written in a device’s native programming language and are built into binary executable files that are installed and run on the device. The most popular way to download a native app is by visiting an application store such as Apple’s App Store, Android’s Marketplace, or BlackBerry’s App World, but other methods exist and are sometimes provided by the mobile vendor.

Native apps are typically fast, reliable, and can access all the the device’s hardware (camera, accelerometer, compass, etc). Because of this increased performance, mobile games are usually built as native apps. It also means, though, that your app is tied to the platform it is built for. An iOS app, for example, won’t run on an Android device without first re-coding the entire app to Java.

### Web applications

Modern mobile devices consist of powerful browsers that support many new HTML5 capabilities, CSS3 and advanced JavaScript. With recent advancements in this front, HTML5 signals the transition of this technology from a “page definition language” into a powerful development standard for rich, browser-based applications.



### <a id=hybrid></a> Hybrid Applications

A hybrid app is built using web technologies, and then wrapped in a platform-specific shell that allows it to be installed just like a native app. Thus it is sold/accessed through the device’s app store.

PhoneGap is an example of a framework that allows you take a web app and turn it into a native app for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows 7, WebOS, Symbian and more. The hybrid frameworks typically have APIs as well, that allow you to access the device’s hardware and features that are locked out from the browser.

## Purpose of the document <a id="purpose"></a>

At this moment we have a two different approaches for creating mobile applications: native and hybrid. Each of these approaches has its own limitations and benefits. But everytime it's very difficult to choose the right one to go because of many factors from inside: budget, project timeframe, target audience, number of platforms to support.
